# Dropbox-Zendesk Integration

This app sends attachments from Zendesk tickets to Dropbox

* The app currently is not firing the *.done event upon completion of POST to https://api.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/token
 * Once that's fixed I will be able to extract my OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token to start making the REST API calls from Zendesk to Dropbox
